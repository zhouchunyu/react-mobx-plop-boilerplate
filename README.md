# React MobX React-Router 4 Boilerplate

### :tada: React, React-Router@next, MobX and Webpack 2.
## [Demo](http://boilerplate.mhaagens.me)

Just run `npm install` and `npm start`, then go to localhost:3000 to start developing.
To build, run `npm run build`, and to preview run `npm run preview`, then go
to localhost:1234 for the minified production bundle.

#### Async component loading
Components are now loaded async with react-router-loader and the store is injected via MobX Provider. 
If you've downloaded this boilerplate before remember to run `npm install` again.
